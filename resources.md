## Resources for Future Learning

After this workshop you will have a foundation for building future knowledge and skills in R and data analysis. However, we have barely scratched the surface in terms of what R is, what R can do, and more generally how to code or do data analysis. Below are our favorite resources for learning R.

The most comprehensive inventory of R related resources and educational material can be found on [RStudio's website](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/). Check out the huge inventory of guidelines, workshop material, videos, and other useful content.
